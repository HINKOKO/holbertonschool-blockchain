## **Overview**

The Low-Level and Blockchain Specialization ends-up with this **awesome** project, where we build an entire Blockchain in **pure C** :star: <br>
**C, C , C and moooaaaarre C !!!** :rocket: <br>
This huge project is splitted into: **Cryptography** . **Data Structures** . **Block Mining** . **Transactions** . **CLI**

## **Crypto**

The first of this series is about **Cryptography**, we use for that purpose the **OpenSSL** Library, we take advantage of that library to accomplish the following:

- Hash various sequence of bytes with `sha256` algorithm
- Generating Key-pair (public and private) on the Elliptic Curve `secp256k1` (Bitcoin curve , satisfying the equation `y^2 = x^3 + 7`)
- Giving birth to an `EC_KEY` -> Elliptic Curve Cryptographic pair from a public key
- From an `EC_KEY` -> retrieving a pub key
- Signing messages/transactions
- Verifying signatures validity

## **Data structures**

## **Block Mining**

## **Transactions**

## **CLI**
